An open-source platform for creating, sharing, and modifying 3D printable models, schematics, and code for robotic and intelligent cosplay exoskeletons.

## About The Project

Welcome to **OpenCosplayer**! This repository is a free human-made collection of resources for building advanced, intelligent, and semi-intelligent robotic skeletons for cosplay. Whether you're a maker, an engineer, or a cosplayer looking to bring your creations to the next level, you've come to the right place.

My goal is to provide a central hub for:
*   **3D Models:** Parametric and modular 3D printable parts for exoskeletons.
*   **Schematics:** Wiring diagrams and hardware plans for integrating electronics.
*   **Code:** Firmware and software to control motors, lights, and other interactive elements.

This project is built on the principle of open collaboration. Feel free to use, modify, and share your own versions of these designs!

## Getting Started

To get started with the project files, you will need access to certain tools and software.

*   **For 3D Models (.stl, .step, .f3d):**
    *   A 3D printer and slicing software (e.g., PrusaSlicer, Cura).
    *   CAD software for viewing or modifying models (e.g., Autodesk Fusion 360, FreeCAD).
*   **For Schematics (.pdf, .sch):**
    *   A PDF viewer or electronics design software (e.g., KiCad, Eagle).
*   **For Code (.ino, .cpp):**
    *   An IDE compatible with your target microcontroller (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO).

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Nexeros/OpenCosplayer.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the specific project folder you are interested in (e.g., `/models/arm_actuator_v1/`).
3.  Follow the instructions in that folder's `README.md` file for specific build details.


See the [open issues](https://github.com/Nexeros/OpenCosplayer/issues) for a full list of proposed features and known issues.
